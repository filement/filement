	cd /usr/ports/devel/git && make install clean
	cd /usr/ports/devel/pkgconf && make install clean
	cd /usr/ports/lang/gcc && make install clean
	cd /usr/ports/security/gnutls && make install clean
	cd /usr/ports/multimedia/ffmpeg && make install clean

## Installation on Android

Install required packages.

	sudo apt-get install google-android-ndk-installer

Download Android studio from https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html and install it.
Installation of additional packages like a specific SDK version may be required.

If you need to debug the application, some additional packages are needed.

	sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb

TODO install java sdk

Configure and compile for Android. This will require specifying the path to your NDK directory. This will typically be /usr/lib/android-ndk/ (you can check with `dpkg -L google-android-ndk-installer`).

	./configure --android-ndk=<path_to_ndk>
	make android.apk

## Installation for desktop platforms

Download the source.

	git clone https://github.com/filement/filement.git
	cd filement

Prepare the source for compilation.

	./configure

Compile the source with one of the following commands:

	make filement-gtk	# compiles only the graphical frontend
	make filement		# compiles only the command line frontend
	make all			# compiles both frontends

Install filement.

	sudo make install

If you install the graphical interface, you may want to update the index of available icons.

	sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor

# Running Filement

In order to start using Filement, you need to create an account in filement.com and then register your device.
Visit http://www.filement.com/register to create an account.

Registration is done by running any of the filement executables and specifying the email of your account and a name and password for the device. The password is used to protect the access to the device from within your account.
Two executables are available. Both can be used to start the filement device server. On the first start, the device must be registered in the Filement infrastructure. After the registration, the device will start automatically on login.

executable name: filement
	Intended to be used from the command line.

executable name: filement-gtk
	Intended to be used from a graphical environment (available in the category Network applications).

# Uninstalling Filement

To uninstall Filement from your PC, execute make in the directory where you compiled Filement:

	make uninstall

	version and platform information on customly compiled devices
	debian and fedora package
	fix android problems
		possible issues: src/server.c has lots of changes and is very hard to check
	automate version deployment; make sure upgrade works
