Installation on Debian

	sudo apt-get install git gcc make zlib1g-dev libgnutls28-dev libavformat-dev ffmpeg

If you want to use the graphical interface (using GTK+), you also need to install:

	sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev

	./configure

Two executables will be created. Both can be used to start the filement device server.
