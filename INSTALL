# Installation from source

## Preparation on Debian 9

Install dependencies.

	sudo apt-get install git gcc make zlib1g-dev libgnutls28-dev libavformat-dev ffmpeg

If you want to use the graphical interface (using GTK+), some additional packages are needed.

	sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev

## Preparation on Fedora 26

Setup RPM fusion to get access to all dependencies.

	sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

Install dependencies.

	sudo dnf install git zlib-devel gnutls-devel ffmpeg-devel

If you want to use the graphical interface (using GTK+), some additional packages are needed.

	sudo dnf install gtk2-devel

## Installation

Download the source.

	git clone https://github.com/filement/filement.git
	cd filement

Prepare the source for compilation.

	./configure

Compile the source with one of the following commands:

	make filement-gtk	# compiles only the graphical frontend
	make filement		# compiles only the command line frontend
	make all			# compiles both frontends

Install filement.

	sudo make install

If you install the graphical interface, you may want to update the index of available icons.

	sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor

## Fedora
