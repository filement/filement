Installation on Debian

	sudo apt-get install git gcc make zlib1g-dev libgnutls28-dev libavformat-dev ffmpeg

If you want to use the graphical interface (using GTK+), you also need to install:

	sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev

	./configure

	make

	sudo make install

Two executables will be created. Both can be used to start the filement device server.

filement
	Intended to be used from the command line.
	You have to manually make sure that the application is run after a restart.

filement-gtk
