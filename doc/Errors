---- Standard error codes ----
The error codes are described in include/types.h

A successful operation (no error) is represented by the value 0. One macro is defined for each error code. The macro ERROR represents a generic error (one that can not be classified as a specific type).

The values used for error codes are all negative. This leaves the positive numbers available so that a given function can return a positive number indicating some result on success or error code on failure.
