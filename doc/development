# Created files

On device registration, the device creates a database in the home directory of the user running the application.
~/.filement.db
While the application is running, a file-based lock is used to ensure no second instance of the application can start. This is facilitated by the file ~/.filement.run
Also, a startup entry is added for the filement server that ensures it will start on login. This entry is platform-specific (in ~/.profile and ~/.login for filement; in ~/.config/autostart for filement-gtk; using the mac API for cocoa).

# Creating installation packages

If you need to create an installation package, the option --release is normally specified on configuration. It makes sure the created files will correspond to the criteria appropriate for a release (setting path prefix, enabling upgrade when appropriate, etc.)

	./configure --release

For Android, you'll also need to add the android-ndk option.

## Creating deb package

	make filement.deb

## Creating RPM package

	make filement.rpm

## Creating dmg archive

	make filement.dmg

## Creating apk package

	make filement.apk

# Debugging

To debug filement, you need to add the option --debug so that debug logging is enabled, debug symbols are added to the executable, etc.

	./configure --debug

In order to use the debug library, include its path to the list of directories with libraries.

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib

The executable will be in the bin directory.

	gdb bin/filement

You'll probably want to set some gdb options.

	handle SIGPIPE nostop
	set follow-fork-mode child

## Debugging on Mac

You can generate the necessary debug symbols on mac with:

	dsymutil lib/libfilement.dylib -o lib/libfilement.dylib.dSYM

On Mac, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH is of no use. You'll need to set another variable from inside gdb:

	set env DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH <path_to_filement>/lib

# Development for Android

For Android development, you'll need Android Studio. You can download Android studio from https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html and then install it. Installation of additional packages like a specific SDK version may be required.

If you need to debug the application, some additional packages are needed.

	sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb
